BUSINESS INTERPRETATION
-----------------------------------------------------
- Crises such as the 2008 GFC and COVID-19 lead to sharp but temporary labor shocks.
- Decades with low variance (e.g., 1990s) signal economic stability and healthier job markets.
- The COVID-19 spike was more severe but shorter-lived than the 2008 crisis.
- Monitoring long-term trends helps anticipate business cycles, optimize hiring, and manage risk.
